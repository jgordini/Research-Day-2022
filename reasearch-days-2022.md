Research computing — and how it can empower researchers at UAB and beyond — will be front and center at the annual Research Computing Days, set for March 1-2, 2022, at UAB.

Join us for two days of workshops, keynote speakers and training as we discuss high-performance computing and research. The free event, taking place virtually and at the fourth-floor atrium at Lister Hill Library, will include breakfast and an optional social event.

UAB is home to [Cheaha, Alabama’s fastest supercomputer](https://www.uab.edu/it/home/research-computing), which supported more than $213 million in research expenditures in fiscal year 2021 alone.

Please note [UAB’s COVID guidelines](http://uab.edu/uabunited), which currently require masks for all individuals indoors on campus.
